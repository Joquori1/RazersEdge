Note: These charts are not supported on IE11 or sooner browsers. One of the charting library's used is from JSCharting. The native fetch() function is not supported in Internet Explorer 11. If you want to support this browser as well, you can use the JSC.fetch() function which comes with JSCharting. It provides the same functionality, but adds additional support for IE11.
