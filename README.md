<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### <b>Project Overview</b>

Razors Edge's data visualization web application is a class project for the <b>Kingsland University Full Stack Developer</b> program.

Our web app leverages charting libraries to build charts, graphs and maps using datasets pulled from a series of APIs.
<br>

### <b>Technical Requirements</b>

Build a front end, mobile first, responsive web app using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### <b>Team Response A: Fulfillment of Technical Requirements</b>

<ol>
    <li>Project is an entirely Front End application.</li>
    <li>Only JavaScript, HTMLs and CSS were used.</li>
    <li>No Backend, Node, database or user registration/login was used.</li>
    <li>We accessed 2 remote APIs: Forbes & ISS satellite real-time API endpoints. Two other datasets were fetched as CSV files and parsed into JSON.</li>
    <li>We also used 3 charting libraries:  </li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Chart.js</b> for Forbes & temperature datasets</li> 
        <li><b>JSCharting</b> for life expectancy dataset, </li> 
        <li><b>Leaflet</b> for ISS dataset</li> 
    </ol>
    <li>We used <b>Ionicons</b> for the icons featured on a few of the 'Chart It' buttons.</li>
    <li>We implemented the following for mobile first, responsive design:</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Bootstrap</b></li>
        <li>The home page uses a combination of a CSS clip-path generator and a pseudo element 'shim' to create and position hexagonal, gateway 'buttons' that link to their respective dataset-category pages. The positions of the hexagonal buttons are designed to expand and collapse depending on the user's screen size.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Our README.md is based on a pared down version of a popular template from GitHub.</li>
    <li>Each team member made a minimum of 1 pull request merged into the main.</li>
    <li>We deployed our project on Netlify.</li>
</ol>
